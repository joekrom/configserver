How to enable hostname resolution (dns) for lxd containers from the lxd host?
First, add the DNS server of lxdbr0.
- 1: resolvectl dns lxdbr0 $(ip -f inet addr show lxdbr0 | sed -En -e 's/.*inet ([0-9.]+).*/\1/p')
Second, make sure all requests to *.lxd are sent to that DNS server.
- 2:sudo resolvectl domain lxdbr0 lxd


After this, any requests to containername.lxd will be resolved to the container IP address. Make sure to add .lxd to the hostname.
Note that this config will be forgotten after a reboot.
